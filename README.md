# UserManager
 A program that manages given users. It takes in a varargs amount of users and allows the end-user to filter the users down to certain things like their ID or address.

# How to use
 Specify the each item with the current syntax: NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, PHONE
 Don't worry nothing will happen if you mess up, it will remind you the syntax and you will see what you inputed,
 and also the ID of the user. Remember to delimit each user in a Text File with a new line!
 ## Commands
 This is more recommended for file users, since these commands condense the file into what you would like to see.
 AGE - Filters the ages of all specified users
 
 USER_ID - Filters the created ID of each user 
 
 ADDRESS - Filters the address of each user
 
 PHONE - Filters the phone number of each user
 
 END - Ends the process

# Updates
You can now specify your users through a text file.
